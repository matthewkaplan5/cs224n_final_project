# CS224N Default Final Project
## Authors: Matthew Kaplan, Jane Boettcher, Jacklyn Luu

This is the GitHub Repository for Matthew, Jane, and Jackyln's CS224N Default Final Project (SQuAD 2.0 Track).

All of the up to date code to consider is in the main branch. It includes all of the original Python files from the project in addition to a Python notebook
where we demonstrate the linguistic analysis we did on the different models.
